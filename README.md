# pong-game

This Java project was created as an assignment for the course ECSE202 Introduction to Software Development during the Fall2021 term at McGill University.
It is an implementation of the classic Pong game; it simulates a ping pong ball being thrown between the user and the computer, and keeps track of the score when 
either of them misses the ball. 

The ppSim class is the main class of this project; each class is described in more detail within the files.
